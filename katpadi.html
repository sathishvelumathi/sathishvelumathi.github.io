                  Gopal samuthram the natural water catchment lake collects runoff water from the northwestern part of the site. The twin ponds in

                  the fabric which has to seamlessly evolve over time is failing in most places like VG Rao nagar. 
                  Introduction of new blocks are transforming fabrics into fragmented parallels and cul-de-sac which has its own advantages 
                  and disadvantages like privacy and less connectivity respectively. This has stopped areas like VG Rao nagar to develop from 
                  residential to mixed-use retail to dense urban zones. Now the zone has its own problems like amenities and public transportation 
                  access in close proximities.

                  disconnected from each other thus open voids are lacking spatial definition and ownership. Often these open spaces end up as dump yards, drainage 
                  outlet and surface parking.

                  like low lying pond areas and irrigation canals. The Upper Katpadi diverts its sullage  into the twin ponds in Ward-6, whereas 
                  lower Katpadi diverts its sullage into the Kalinjur surplus water canal that traces its path to Palar river. All the open channels 
                  that collect sullage are powered by gravity. Sluggish movement of sullage due to the accumulation of sludge
                  and solid waste is thrown into the open channel. Water gets accumulated results in breeding of mosquitos, 
                  insects, rodents, stray dogs resulting in unsanitary 
                  conditions throughout the area. Irrigation canals are polluted making it unfit for future agricultural purpose.

                  In case of rain and the pond reaching max height, the channel to the female pond nearby is cut open. This leaves the 
                  site surrounding pond unfit for living with its ground water polluted, soil contaminated henceforth it has become an 
                  easy place for very low economic people to settle in as slums. Thus the ponds which were natural rainwater catchments 
                  has lost its identity and connection to the city. Drainage lines from ward 3, 5 clogs while trying to cross the railway 
                  line and divert into nearby lands and form pools of drainage water inhabiting pigs, rodents, snakes and mosquitos. 
                  With almost every street having only open drains collecting sullage there are health issues in every ward with mosquitos and rodents.

              <p>The present Kalinjur Surplus canal carries the overflown water from Kalinjur lake which has become a rare 
                scenario. In recent times the canal has been pumped with untreated sullage from the households diverting 
                into the Palar river. In ward 6 it also acts as a concrete storm water drain which has been polluted the 
                inhabitants by continous letting out of drainage and dumping of waste. The main sewer line takes a turn 
                along the auxillium college’s perimeter and takes the route through Kangeyanallur, Brahmapuram, Sevur, 
                Karnambut and dumps the waste into Palar river at Thiruvalam.
