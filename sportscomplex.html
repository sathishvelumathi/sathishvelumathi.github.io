                <h2>Sports Complex</h2>
                <p>The site located amidst the residential zone of Katpadi is along the irrigation canal carrying the surplus water from 
                  Kalinjur lake. Katpadi is devoid of potential recreaational spaces and need one as a breathing space escaping from the 
                  rushing commercial spine and inward looking residential environment. The irrigation canal currently carrying sewage 
                  and sullage of Katpadi is reclaimed with the new government underground sewage system proposal can be used as potential 
                  open and recreational spaces as it runs cutting through Katpadi along the roads making it easily 
                  accessible. Devoid of open spaces and provision of sports and fitness stresses the ibtroduction of sports complex in 
                  the area. With mostly residential buildings expect for the Vellore - Chitoor road commercial spine the areas are empty 
                  in the day time with no activities as the men go to Vellore or Chennai for work on daily basis leaving the housewives 
                  behind with no provision to spend time outside home. Hence a combination of self-help group and sports complex in a 
                  community hall along the canal would be a potential intervention for the residents.

            <h3>Site Location and Orientation</h3>
            <p>The site chosen to house the Community hall is a 1700 sq.m corner plot located in VG Rao nagar along the irrigation 
              canal accessible through 7th East main road and Second main road. The junction is always active with people as it is 
              shaded with neighbouring buildings and also falls on the school route. Frontage to the site is given on the eastern 
              side with a larger front setback so that the building doesn't make the junction crampy and is used for parking. The 
              Northern side is opened to the canal which is integrated with check dams and steps to store water throughout the year. 
              With Vellore getting average rainfall of about 150 cm rainfall per year, if rainwater is stored in the site only in 
              an underground sump it would be sufficient to pump water to the canal stretch along the site during the months of 
              April May June when the weather is extremely hot and dry. With water on the canal on these three months, the 
              residential zone along the canal gets humidified air with the eastern dry wind hitting the water. The southern side 
              is lined with services thus cutting down the heat in the usable areas.

            <h3>Ground Floor</h3>
            <p>The Community hall is put in the front for ease of access for people and the sports complex is provided in the rear 
              part of the site. An amphitheatre is provided at the front looking into the junction making it feel more open and 
              connecting with the street. The amphitheatre has a waterbody which humidify the dry eastern wind thus making the 
              amphitheatre usable in hot summer time noon to the housewives who generally sit out on the streets. The space under 
              amphitheatre is used as arena for box-cricket. Separate courtyard, informal seating and storage area are given to 
              the self-help group for unhindered functioning within the diversely functioning building Provision of a library 
              with a mezzanine reading area is made as there is no library nearby in VG Rao nagar. The rear part of the site 
              has a sunken multipurpose hall which can be used as a skating ring, futsal court, performance and exhibition area. 
              A rear entrance is provided from the canal and also a passage from front entrance giving direct access to sports 
              complex.
