              Dhanushkodi is a thin spit land-formation on the south coast of India, where the Bay of Bengal 
              and the Indian Ocean meet. The colonial British established a port town here for ease of trade 
              and movement. In 1964 a cyclone which is considered to be a modern-day super cyclonic storm 
              struck the town at midnight swept away the entire town leaving only the foundations and few walls 
              made of stone. The Government declared the town a ghost town after the effects of the cyclone. 
              The land remained isolated supporting a wide range of natural habitats that include lagoons, dunes, 
              casuarina forests, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and much more. Ensuing the cyclone, access was only 
              through walking or off-road trek limited the number of visitors to the abandoned town. Extension of 
              NH 49 to the tip of the land spit introduced a spike in the tourists landing to catch the sight of 
              the striking seascapes with white sand, blue skies, ruins that stand as a testimony to the forgotten 
              past and to connect with the mythological stories of Ramayana. This sudden boom of tourism has been 
              detrimental in many ways to the local community and its natural ecosystem. This sharp rise cannot be 
              cut back, but it can be processed and managed as controlled tourism.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Architectural thesis focuses on re-imagining the past and transforming the future of the town 
              by celebrating the expression of unity between the distinct natural environment and man-made environment. 
              The abandoned ruins have a compelling beauty, demonstrating a repurposed, rescued architecture to the ruins, 
              and a reimagined architecture adjacent and around it has the beauty and power to change the life of the 
              community and the town.

                  Gulf of Mannar running to a stretch of 140 km from the coast of Ramanathapuram to Thoothukudi
                   covering 10,500 sq.km was announced as a Biosphere reserve in 1989. It was the first Biosphere
                    Reserve in South-east Asia. There are about 4223 species of flora and fauna found in this 
                    Biosphere Reserve. The Gulf has abundant seagrass beds thus habituating endangered species 
                    like Dugongs, seahorses, etc. The Biosphere contains 21 Islands along the shore (8km away) 
                    in which two are submerged. The Coral reef has developed in these Islands and the shore 
                    acting as a Wave cut platform and shelter bed of marine species. The current movement is 
                    normally dependent on the monsoon.

                  Declared as ‘Ghost town’ the old port town still houses the fishing community that 
                  depends on the fishing grounds. The Fishermen have relocated 19 km from their fishing 
                  grounds post-cyclone from where the closest shore was 3 km, henceforth Fishermen 
                  shifted back to Dhanushkodi. Around 230 families (approx 850 people) in their 
                  thatched houses are spread all around the standing ruins.  Dhanushkodi has fishing 
                  grounds on both north and south (Bay of Bengal & Indian ocean) which helps them to 
                  carry on fishing throughout the year by hopping between the two fishing grounds which 
                  isn’t available elsewhere. Intertidal zone stores water for four months where fish, 
                  prawns, crabs lay eggs and breed. The living standard is worrying with the unavailability 
                  of the drinking water source, toilets and waste generation from the visiting tourists.

                  Palam is a pure fishing community that keeps itself away from the tourist boon. 
                  The lagoon acts as a natural edge for the community. Palam is where the groundwater 
                  is not brackish and its available in just three feet. Locals use the groundwater 
                  for domestic purpose and the drinking water is bought from tankers coming from 
                  Rameswaram. Good ground water supports various vegetations like Palm, Coconut, 
                  Neem, Banana, Pungai and other flowering plants. A Fish import and bargaining 
                  centre is built right in front of the old port by the state government which is 
                  not used to its desired potential but as a recreational space for the local kids 
                  and fishermen. The Housing units are small thatch units that are programmatically 
                  transformable and kitchens spread within a thatch or palm rachis compound.

                  The NH 49 runs through Kambipadu providing easy access for the tourists to the 
                  ruins. The locals put up stalls and shacks along the road to generate additional income. 
                  Now with the tourist count uptick fishing has shifted to the sidelines. Shells 
                  collected by the local fishermen are traded with fisherwomen who produce handicrafts that 
                  are sold to the tourists. The Old Church, Railway station, Water tank are major tourist 
                  attractions. The Ruins are built of corals, brick, Stone masonry, steel posts and sections. 
                  Auto drivers providing round trip around Rameswaram, finish the trip by visiting Dhanushkodi 
                  at sunset. Auto drivers lack in information about the ruins, exploit the tourists with false
