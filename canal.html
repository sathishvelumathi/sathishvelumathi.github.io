            <h2>Irrigation Canal</h2>
            <p>The present Kalinjur Surplus canal carries the overflown water from Kalinjur lake which has become a rare scenario.
              In recent times the canal has been pumped with only untreated sullage from the households diverting into the Palar river.
              The new proposal puts a STP in viruthampattu of capacity 50 MLD which treats sewage from all these wards and diverts the 
              treated water into Pandiyan canal which is the irrigation canal carrying surplus from kalinjur lake which is pretty much 
              empty or has less water throughout the year. Thus the treated water can be used for irrigation on its way to Palar river. 
              The STP is assisted with SPS (Sewage Pump Station) 10 pump the sewage to higher regions. There are 3 SPS proposed in this 
              subproject placed in Kangeyanallur. Viruthampattu and Sathuperi.

            <p>The canal runs along the Katpadi region varying in width and depth. The Irrigation 
              canal is divided into six zones based on the width, depth, type of landscape and, 
              the neighbourhood it runs along.
              The Irrigation canal runs through different contours varying in width and depth. 
              The cross section area of the canal has to be maintained as 6 sq.m to carry the 
              maximum amount of water 19 cumecs that can be opened from Kalinjur lake at flood 
              times. Running along the city the canal is concretised for quicker runoff and 
              easy cleaning and maintainance. With the new govt. underground drainage proposal the 
              irrigation canal doesnâ€™t have to carry sullage and sewage anymore. which creates 
              an opputunity to create recreational and potential open spaces for the city with 
              incorporation of cycle tracks, pavements, seaters etc.

                  Palam is a pure fishing community that keeps itself away from the tourist boon. 
                  The lagoon acts as a natural edge for the community. Palam is where the groundwater 
                  is not brackish and its available in just three feet. Locals use the groundwater 
                  for domestic purpose and the drinking water is bought from tankers coming from 
                  Rameswaram. Good ground water supports various vegetations like Palm, Coconut, 
                  Neem, Banana, Pungai and other flowering plants. A Fish import and bargaining 
                  centre is built right in front of the old port by the state government which is 
                  not used to its desired potential but as a recreational space for the local kids 
                  and fishermen. The Housing units are small thatch units that are programmatically 
                  transformable and kitchens spread within a thatch or palm rachis compound.

                  The NH 49 runs through Kambipadu providing easy access for the tourists to the 
                  ruins and temples. The Fishing community put up stalls and shacks 
                  along the road to generate additional income. Now with the tourist count uptick 
                  fishing has shifted to the sidelines. Shells and fish collected by the local fishermen 
                  are traded with fisherwomwn whp produce handicrafts that are sold to the tourists. The Old Church, Railway 
                  station, Water tank are the major tourist attractions. The Ruins were built of corals, 
                  brick masonry, Stone masonry, Steel sections and posts. Auto drivers providing round trip around 
                  Rameswaram, finish the trip by visiting Dhanushkodi by sunset. auto drivers lack in information 
                  about the area, exploit the tourists with false information. The ruins are in a bad state with no maintainance. 
                  Only arches, vaults and few masonry walls remain intact post cyclone.

                  The Aaru (Lagoon) traps the high tide water rising over the narrow land strip on the 
                  northern side (Bay of Bengal) and rainwater during the North-East Monsoon ie. December 
                  to March. Smaller ecosystem living in this lagoon like fishes, prawns and crabs are 
                  caught by the locals and used for domestic cooking. The Aaru is the major recreational 
                  space for the locals as its safe for even children with only 2 feet water. Festivals 
                  and recreational activities like Panguni Thiruvila, Kite flying, Boating competition 
                  etc. Every year 10,000 migratory visits and nest in these lagoons in Dhanushkodi 
                  attracting many nature lovers and Bird watchers.
