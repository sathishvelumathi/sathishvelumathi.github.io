            <h2>Irrigation Canal</h2>
            <p>The present Kalinjur Surplus canal carries the overflown water from Kalinjur lake which has become a rare scenario.
              In recent times the canal has been pumped with only untreated sullage from the households diverting into the Palar river.
              The new proposal puts a STP in viruthampattu of capacity 50 MLD which treats sewage from all these wards and diverts the 
              treated water into Pandiyan canal which is the irrigation canal carrying surplus from kalinjur lake which is pretty much 
              empty or has less water throughout the year. Thus the treated water can be used for irrigation on its way to Palar river. 
              The STP is assisted with SPS (Sewage Pump Station) 10 pump the sewage to higher regions. There are 3 SPS proposed in this 
              subproject placed in Kangeyanallur. Viruthampattu and Sathuperi.

              As the Irrigation canal is going to carry the treated water and surface runoff water during rainy season 
              the water level alters with altering seasons. The canals are wide to be used as potential open spaces with 
              integration of soft and hard landscapes which allows percolation of water into the ground level. The 
              irrigation canal runs to a length of 15 km from kalinjur to Thiuvalam with 2km stretch running across 
              the site connecting major school routes. Cycling route and tracks can be provided with raised ground level 
              along the canal which can be used by school kids and economical weaker section as they are the only group 
              using cycle in present time. This can promote pedal transportation in near future. Running a long distance 
              through various wards the water carried gets polluted which can be cleaned using introduction of constructed 
              wetlands.

            <p>The canal runs along the Katpadi region varying in width and depth. The Irrigation 
              canal is divided into six zones based on the width, depth, type of landscape and, 
              the neighbourhood it runs along.
              The Irrigation canal runs through different contours varying in width and depth. 
              The cross section area of the canal has to be maintained as 6 sq.m to carry the 
              maximum amount of water 19 cumecs that can be opened from Kalinjur lake at flood 
              times. Running along the city the canal is concretised for quicker runoff and 
              easy cleaning and maintainance. With the new govt. underground drainage proposal the 
              irrigation canal doesnâ€™t have to carry sullage and sewage anymore. which creates 
              an opputunity to create recreational and potential open spaces for the city with 
              incorporation of cycle tracks, pavements, seaters etc.

                  The Irrigation canal starts from Kalinjur lake, the initial
                   low lying areas of the canal have slums on both sides. The 
                   existing canal is used as a dump yard. The design proposal 
                   is to reduce the water channel and have planter boxes and 
                   seaters in the remaining area to invite people to use the 
                   canal as a backyard.

                  The Irrigation canal runs through a deep concrete canal past 
                  the slum. The canal is empty and unused for almost 8 months, 
                  instead can be used for recreational activities. The Design 
                  proposal is to have multilevel recreational spaces that can 
                  be used in almost every season with altering water level.
