              <h2>Entrance Complex</h2>
              <p>
                The Entrance complex site is located 13 km from the Dhanushkodi town. The Coastal regulation 
                zones start from this point. Hence this site is best suited to house all the major services to 
                the visitors. NH 49 runs till the tip of the land spit through MR Chathiram, Dhanushkodi, and 
                Arichalmunnai. The site is surrounded by Protected forest on the northern and western ends, 
                and by CRZ 1B zones in the southem and eastem ends.

                The Site is two high lands on the northwestern and southeastern end. A steep slope is observed 
                in the northern end of the site along the forest which collects runoff water from the site and 
                the protected forest. The low lying area is 2400 mm below the road level. Contour lines are 
                drawn every 250 mm. The site is divided into three parts based on the vegetation and contour, 
                The first part is flat, open, and has less vegetation, The second site is steep, has a perennial 
                water body and tall, dense casuarina vegetation and the third site has slight undulations and 
                has sparse shrub vegetation.

                    Visitors arriving in different modes of road transportation are received in the public plaza. Entry 
                    to the site is by climbing down the ramp that connects the visitors with the water body. Pedestrian 
                    movement is encouraged around the water body and the waiting area and restaurants are placed as such 
                    they have an uninterrupted view to the water body. After collecting the ticket the visitors are taken 
                    through the photo gallery and Gulf of Mannar museum to the boarding point.

                    The Visitors climb down the entrance ramp from the public plaza to reach - 2400 level. They are 
                    welcomed by a double-height pergola entry extending view into the water catchment area. The 
                    Pathway extends to the lake trall that runs along the periphery of the water catchment area 
                    and the waiting lounge. The Double height Pergola entrance extends Into the Lake trail which 
                    takes the visitors along the periphery of the water catchment area. The trail climbs level 
                    with a series of ramps and steps in accordance with mother nature.

                    The central spine runs in between the restaurant and the waiting complex along the length of the 
                    site directing the pedestrian movement towards the boarding point. The Spine is built to make 
                    the most of the existing tall dense casuarina vegetation. Seaters are made around the trees. 
                    The space is very much contained with buildings around and reachable. The restaurant has 
                    punctures in the root to co-exist with the existing trees. Ticketing counter breaks the 
                    monotonous stretch of the Central spine. Visitors start their Journey towards Dhanushkodi 
                    after collecting their tickets and baggage checked. On the other side, visitors return to 
                    the entrance complex completing their trip to Dhanushkodi and culminate in the central spine. 
                    These two pathways are separated by a Battery cat lane that shuttles between the Public 
                    plaza and Boarding point to transport elderly and differently abled visitors.

                    Collecting the tickets from the ticket counter the journey to the abandoned town kick starts 
                    with a series of photo display on glass boxes along the pathway to give schema of what they 
                    could expect in Dhanushkodi. The Glass boxes are naturally and artificially lighted from 
                    above with a northern opening above. The Long Corridor is a series of altering spatial 
                    experience and the Gulf of Mannar biosphere museum cuts right at the centre of the pathway 
                    displaying the rich culture and importance of the biosphere. The Gulf of Mannar museum bisects 
                    the photo gallery pathway with a water body diverting the pathway. The Museum has two Display 
                    halls and a water body running between the two buildings and extending into the pathway 
                    making a symbolic representation of the gulf. The Museum has large 
                    glass openings looking into the protected forest that floods the display hall with natural 
                    light. The visitors are taken to the entry in the first floor through a stairway and later 
                    to the second display hall, The exit opens into the Photo Gallery pathway right after the water body.
                    The Photo gallery pathway opens into the boarding and arrival plaza. The plaza has an OAT, 
                    restrooms and Boarding station from where the visitors can either take a tram or buggy service 
                    to reach the next destination Vibishan temple.
